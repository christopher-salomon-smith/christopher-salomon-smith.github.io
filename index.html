                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br />
                <p>I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics double major entering my third year at Stony Brook University. A sampling of my many academic interests includes: statistics and probability theory, data engineering and analysis, reinforcement learning (specifically the Multi-Armed Bandit problem), algorithms, data structures, computational geometry, and self-studying pure mathematics. One day I hope to have something cool to show for all of these interests, but for now I just have some budding research, hobbies, and projects showcased on this site.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Putting academics aside, I was born and raised in Chandler, Arizona. For anyone familiar with the Chandler Unified School District, I attended CTA Liberty, ACP Oakland, and Perry High School. I've been an avid soccer player for many years, and recently I also started getting into distance running. Above all however, I would have to say that my favorite thing to do is just learn - learn anything, anywhere, anytime.</p>
