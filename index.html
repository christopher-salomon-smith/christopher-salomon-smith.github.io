                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I am a Computer Science and Mathematics double major in my third year at Stony Brook University seeking summer 2021 internship positions in software engineering or data analysis.
                    I have a versatile skill set with industry experience in developing production quality software, and I am driven by a need to figure out why things work and how we can make them work better.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2019 I was an intern at Western Alliance Bank in Phoenix, Arizona, where I used a several languages/frameworks (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, SQL) and other technologies (Tableau, PDO drivers, MS SQL Server, Microsoft IIS) to develop several applications that were put into
                    production. These applications were Tableau extensions that made time-consuming, unwieldy processes like collecting new customer data and regrading loans instantaneous and auditable. As the sole developer, I had to regularly meet with management all the way up to the C-Suite level in order to tailor
                    the application design to their business needs and to communicate my progress. I was in charge of both the front end and back end, and I had to secure the application against cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks. I also had to work closely with IT when it came time to deploy the applications
                    to production.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I am also currently part of the Secure Distributed Computation and Learning Networks VIP research team at Stony Brook University. For the past two years, I have worked closely
                    with Professor Ji Liu in developing novel formulations and algorithms for the distributed multi-armed bandit problem. My contributions include performing in-depth reviews of the literature, implementing simulations of novel algorithms 
                    to produce experimental results that confirm theoretical analysis, and providing guidance for newer team members.

                <p>In my free time I play a lot of soccer and self-study math textbooks (yeah I know, I'm a nerd).</p>
