                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br />
                <p>I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics double major entering my third year at Stony Brook University. My current interests include: statistics and probability theory, real analysis, data engineering and analysis, bandit problems, and blockchain interoperability. The research page features my work on these last two topics, the self study blog hosts notes, exercises, and reflections on math books I'm working through, and the projects page showcases a variety of random things I've built.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I was born and raised in Chandler, Arizona. For anyone familiar with the Chandler Unified School District, I attended CTA Liberty, ACP Oakland, and Perry High School. I've been an avid soccer player for many years, and recently I also started getting into distance running. Above all however, I would have to say that my favorite thing to do is just learn - learn anything, anywhere, anytime.</p>
